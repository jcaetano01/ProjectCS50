# Map and Equipment Selector
    #### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/8Q5J1ZOIDGQ>
    #### Description:This project is a text-based "Map and Equipment Selector," designed for terminal interaction, allowing the user to simulate game-like choices. The user can select from seven unique maps, choose among five different weapons, each with specific qualities, and decide on a gameplay role, either attacking or defending. Designed for simplicity and usability, the program includes descriptions for each weapon, making it easy for the user to understand their advantages and ideal usage scenarios.The terminal interface leverages the "Blessed" library to enhance user engagement. Through bold and colored text, the program visually organizes each selection step, providing clear guidance and maintaining a structured experience as the user moves from map selection to weapon choice, and finally, side selection. Starting with the maps, the program presents a list of seven fictional map names, each with a corresponding number to streamline the selection process. These maps are creatively named to evoke typical tactical game environments, adding a fun thematic element. The user simply enters the number corresponding to their preferred map, making navigation intuitive and straightforward.Next, the user is presented with five weapon options. Each weapon is accompanied by a brief description, highlighting its strengths and characteristics. This allows the user to make an informed decision based on their preferred style of play. For example, some weapons are designed for close-range encounters, while others excel at medium or long distances. This simple yet informative approach adds a strategic dimension to the equipment choice, reminiscent of tactical game mechanics.The program then proceeds to the side selection stage, where the user can choose to either attack or defend. This choice is made using a simple number input, with clear feedback provided to confirm the user's role. To enhance usability and prevent errors, the program validates each user input. If the user enters an invalid choice (such as a number outside the expected range or a non-numeric character), the program reprompts them, ensuring that they provide a valid response before moving to the next stage. This input validation is applied to all selection steps—map, weapon, and side—making the program resilient and user-friendly.Additionally, the project includes a comprehensive testing file created with pytest, covering possible invalid inputs to verify that the program handles errors effectively. The test file validates each function, confirming that the program behaves as expected under various input scenarios and passing all six test cases without issues. This reinforces the robustness of the program, ensuring a smooth experience for any user.In summary, this project serves as an engaging, text-based selector for map, equipment, and gameplay role, offering a glimpse into tactical game mechanics while maintaining simplicity. The use of "Blessed" for enhanced terminal aesthetics, combined with input validation and testing, makes this project a well-rounded solution for simulating game-like choices within the terminal environment.
